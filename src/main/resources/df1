# Step 1: Use a base image that has OpenJDK 11 and Maven installed
FROM maven:3.8.6-openjdk-11-slim as builder

# Step 2: Set environment variables for Git credentials and repo details
ARG GIT_USERNAME
ARG GIT_PASSWORD
ARG GIT_REPO_URL
ARG GIT_BRANCH=main

# Step 3: Install Git (if it's not included in the base image)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Step 4: Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 5: Copy your settings.xml file to the container (assuming you have it locally)
# Replace <local-path-to-settings.xml> with the actual path to your settings.xml on your host machine
COPY <local-path-to-settings.xml> /root/.m2/settings.xml

# Step 6: Clone the repository using Git credentials
RUN git clone --branch $GIT_BRANCH https://$GIT_USERNAME:$GIT_PASSWORD@$GIT_REPO_URL .

# Step 7: Build the project with Maven, referring to the copied settings.xml
RUN mvn --settings /root/.m2/settings.xml clean install

# Step 8: Create a new minimal image with just JRE and your application
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

# Step 9: Copy the built artifacts from the Maven image
COPY --from=builder /app /app

# Step 10: Set the working directory in the container for runtime
WORKDIR /app

# Step 11: Define the command to run Karate tests
CMD ["mvn", "test", "-Dtest=KarateRunnerClass"]
