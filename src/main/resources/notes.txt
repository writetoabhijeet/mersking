Purpose of the New Utility Functionality:
The newly developed utility library is intended to fulfill the requirement for a comprehensive and customizable data masking solution. Its primary function is to safeguard sensitive information by masking Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Payment Card Information (PCI) fields. In contrast to existing libraries, which may be limited in scope and flexibility, this utility provides a robust solution that is straightforward to integrate with minimal configuration, while also allowing for extensive customization to cater to specific user requirements.

Key Challenges and Proposed Solutions:
One of the primary challenges in the current landscape has been the absence of a generic library capable of managing a broad spectrum of sensitive data fields with customizable masking strategies. Existing tools typically offer hard-coded logic for masking only a limited number of specific fields, such as Primary Account Numbers (PAN), and do not provide flexibility regarding masking position, character, or field name. The new utility effectively addresses this gap by offering a range of masking strategies that can be tailored based on the number of masking characters, their position, and whether the masking is fixed or dynamically adjusted according to input length. This level of flexibility ensures that the utility can accommodate diverse user requirements, positioning it as a more versatile and powerful solution compared to existing options.

Recommended Approach:
The suggested course of action is to implement this new utility as the standard solution for data masking within applications that manage sensitive information. Its inherent support for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Payment Card Industry (PCI) fields, coupled with the option to customize or suppress specific masking rules, positions it as an excellent choice for organizations aiming to strengthen data privacy initiatives. By adopting this utility, organizations can achieve thorough protection of sensitive data while enjoying seamless integration and the flexibility to adjust masking logic in response to changing requirements.
