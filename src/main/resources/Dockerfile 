# Step 1: Use a base image that has OpenJDK 11 and Maven installed
FROM maven:3.8.6-openjdk-11-slim as builder

# Step 2: Set environment variables for Git credentials and repo details
# These will be passed when building the Docker image or when running the container
ARG GIT_USERNAME
ARG GIT_PASSWORD
ARG GIT_REPO_URL
ARG GIT_BRANCH=main

# Step 3: Install Git (if it's not included in the base image)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Step 4: Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 5: Clone the repository using Git credentials passed via the environment
RUN git clone --branch $GIT_BRANCH https://$GIT_USERNAME:$GIT_PASSWORD@$GIT_REPO_URL .

# Step 6: Build the project with Maven
RUN mvn clean install

# Step 7: Create a new minimal image with just JRE and your application
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

# Step 8: Copy the built artifacts from the Maven image
COPY --from=builder /app/target/your-app.jar /app/your-app.jar

# Step 9: Set the working directory in the container for runtime
WORKDIR /app

# Step 10: Define the command to run your application
CMD ["java", "-jar", "your-app.jar", "specific-command"]
